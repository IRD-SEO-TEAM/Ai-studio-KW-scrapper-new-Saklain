#MATCH THIS EXAMPLE STYLE:
- Al Fatiha means ""the opening."" Surah Fatiha is the opening chapter and introduction to the Quran. It was the first complete Surah revealed to Prophet Muhammad (SAW) in Mecca, during the early period of prophethood. The main content of Surah Fatiha is the establishment of the fundamental principles of Islam. An angel asked Muhammad (SAW) about Surah Fatiha, to which the Prophet replied, ""There are two lights from heaven, one is surah Fatiha and the other is surah Baqarah."" (Sahih Al-Bukhari).

- The longest Surah in the Quran. It addresses various topics ranging from the pillars of Islam, alcohol and gambling, day of Resurrection, marriage and divorce, interest, Islamic finance, stories of various prophets, the Qiblah, Islamic calender, the month of Ramadan, and many more! I won?t be expanding on Surah Baqarah nor giving a summary of it (as Dr Yasir Qadhi does a much better job on his ?message of the Quran series?) but I will however highlight some of my favourite parts and/or reminders, along with clearing some misconceptions.

- Surah Al-Ikhlas is a Quranic chapter that discusses the oneness of Allah and His supreme attributes. It has great virtues, and its recitation is equivalent to one-third of the Quran. As for the exact date, place, and reason for its revelation, there are differences in narrations and opinions among scholars and interpreters. The majority of scholars state that it was revealed in Makkah during the early years of the Prophet?s mission because it is a concise surah that emphasizes the concept of monotheism, which was the initial message of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

- Surah An-Nas, is the 114th chapter of the Quran comprising six verses. Surah An-Nas translates to ?Mankind? or ?People?, reflecting its universal appeal and relevance to the broader human experience. Surah An-Nas serves as a powerful reminder of the constant need for divine refuge in the face of life?s challenges. The Prophet Muhammad ? emphasized the significance of reciting this surah as a way of seeking divine protection from various forms of harm.

- Surah Al-Falaq brings a sense of peace, assurance, and divine connection to Muslims. This chapter, revealed in Makkah, is recited regularly by Muslims around the world, particularly in their morning and evening supplications. It emphasizes the necessity of seeking refuge in Allah alone, not just from obvious dangers, but from hidden and spiritual harms as well. These include the evil of darkness, envy, and sorcery?forces that can silently damage one?s soul and relationships. For children, adults, and the elderly alike, reciting Surah Al-Falaq has become a daily practice of spiritual hygiene. To protect the heart from fear and the mind from negativity."

- The longest Surah in the Quran. It addresses various topics ranging from the pillars of Islam, alcohol and gambling, day of Resurrection, marriage and divorce, interest, Islamic finance, stories of various prophets, the Qiblah, Islamic calender, the month of Ramadan, and many more! I won?t be expanding on Surah Baqarah nor giving a summary of it (as Dr Yasir Qadhi does a much better job on his ?message of the Quran series?) but I will however highlight some of my favourite parts and/or reminders, along with clearing some misconceptions.

- Surah Al-Ikhlas is a Quranic chapter that discusses the oneness of Allah and His supreme attributes. It has great virtues, and its recitation is equivalent to one-third of the Quran. As for the exact date, place, and reason for its revelation, there are differences in narrations and opinions among scholars and interpreters. The majority of scholars state that it was revealed in Makkah during the early years of the Prophet?s mission because it is a concise surah that emphasizes the concept of monotheism, which was the initial message of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

- Surah An-Nas, is the 114th chapter of the Quran comprising six verses. Surah An-Nas translates to ?Mankind? or ?People?, reflecting its universal appeal and relevance to the broader human experience. Surah An-Nas serves as a powerful reminder of the constant need for divine refuge in the face of life?s challenges. The Prophet Muhammad ? emphasized the significance of reciting this surah as a way of seeking divine protection from various forms of harm.

- Surah Al-Falaq brings a sense of peace, assurance, and divine connection to Muslims. This chapter, revealed in Makkah, is recited regularly by Muslims around the world, particularly in their morning and evening supplications. It emphasizes the necessity of seeking refuge in Allah alone, not just from obvious dangers, but from hidden and spiritual harms as well. These include the evil of darkness, envy, and sorcery?forces that can silently damage one?s soul and relationships. For children, adults, and the elderly alike, reciting Surah Al-Falaq has become a daily practice of spiritual hygiene. To protect the heart from fear and the mind from negativity."
